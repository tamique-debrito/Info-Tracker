Yet another todo app. Or maybe more of a task management app. In any case, the point is something that works better for me than what I've found elsewhere.

This is going to be my app for tracking my todos, notes, and projects in a way that is most natural for how I think. The main point is going to make it easier to list what tasks I want to complete, projects I want to start/work on, or ideas I want to contemplate in a central place that lets me defer something if I don't have the time, but doesn't let me forget about it forever (so far, the note apps I've tried don't have a feature to let you look at what you've planned for today and say "actually I want to push these two things back a week, and I actually don't want to start this project today, but remind me in a month or when I say I happen to have 2 hours of unexpected free time". My goal is to be able to do that with 6 clicks).  Part of the point of this is to have something that lets me resolve each thing I planned to do in a day, even if it didn't get finished, which as far as I've seen, todo apps don't support this well because they seem to assume that if you list something as a todo it *will* be done on that day or otherwise it should be considered overdue, which is not accurate for everything I want to track/remember. Plus, as I've implied, many of the things I want to track don't even fit into the category of a "todo" or a "task". And even for those things I end up never doing, maybe in 10 years I'll want to look back and see what kind of stuff I was doing and thinking (as in, this may become a form of electronic journal).
Here's my sketchy sketch for what I'm thinking:
