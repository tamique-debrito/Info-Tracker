This is going to be my app for tracking my todos, notes, and projects in a way that is most natural for how I think. The main point is going to make it easier to list what tasks I want to complete, projects I want to start/work on, or ideas I want to contemplate in a central place that lets me defer something if I don't have the time, but doesn't let me forget about it forever (so far, the note apps I've tried don't have a feature to let you look at what you've planned for today and say "actually I want to push these two things back a week, and I actually don't want to start this project today, but remind me in a month or when I say I happen to have 2 hours of unexpected free time". My goal is to be able to do that with 6 clicks).
Here's my sketchy sketch for what I'm thinking:
